# LRajputMyFavouriteSports
I like this sport because it is my hobby. From my childhood days I play this sport and to keep my body fit. My idol is Rahul Dravid. I learnt alot of his moves while he plays for India. He also get famous from his nick name as The Wall. When he come to the crease he do not get out easily from there he get this name.
By learning all the techniques by watching on Youtube or in Television it become strong part for me how to use my footwork in which bowler as Pacer, spin.
